Intermediate Algorithm Scripting Challenges
Description:
Having grasped the basics of algorithmic thinking, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and Functional Programming, I took on the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting challenges. These challenges were designed to test and expand my problem-solving skills using a mix of algorithmic strategies and programming paradigms.

Technologies Used:
JavaScript: Core language used to implement and test algorithms.
Algorithmic Concepts: Application of OOP, Functional Programming, and intermediate-level algorithms.
Features Implemented:
Algorithmic Problem Solving:

Intermediate Challenges: Tackled problems that required a deeper understanding of algorithms beyond basic scripting.
Examples: Included tasks like manipulating arrays, strings, and objects to meet specific conditions or outputs.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

Encapsulation: Utilized classes and objects to organize code and manage data effectively.
Inheritance and Polymorphism: Applied principles of inheritance and method overriding to solve complex problems.
Functional Programming:

Pure Functions: Implemented solutions using pure functions to ensure predictability and ease of testing.
Higher-Order Functions: Leveraged functions like .map(), .reduce(), and .filter() to process data efficiently.
Advanced Algorithm Techniques:

Recursion: Used recursive functions to solve problems that involve repeating tasks with changing conditions.
Dynamic Programming: Applied dynamic programming concepts to optimize solutions for problems with overlapping subproblems.
